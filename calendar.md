# Course Calendar (Topics and due dates)

See the [Schedule and Roadmap]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success/#time-management-and-scheduling) suggestions. 

In our course, each week covers roughly 1 chapter from zyBooks, and we have the following course activities that need to be completed in zyBooks: 
* **PA**{: .label .label-orange }(Participation Activities), 
* **CA**{: .label .label-blue }(Challenge Activities), 
* **LA**{: .label .label-green }(Lab Activities).

Additionally, at the end of each week, you are asked to reflect on your learning journey that week and submit a **Reflection** linked on Gauchospace.

In order to ensure that you are rewarded for participating during the synchronous, we will be collecting your progress on the breakout room activities and participation in the in-class activities.
