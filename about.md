## UCSB CSW 8 (Introduction to Computer Science) Online Syllabus - Winter 2022   

Introduction to computer program development is for students with little to no programming experience. Basic programming concepts, variables and expressions, data and control structures, algorithms, debugging, program design, testing, and documentation. Note: Programming is concepts + skill, and skill requires <span style="color:green">**practice**</span>.  Many of you will find this class to be different from classes you've taken before.

### Online class
See Gauchospace (Try the Zoom link before the first day; bookmark it for easy access).   

You'll attend class and lab/discussion online via Zoom during specified times, just like a physical class. Class time and labs **require synchronous interactions and active participation**.

**Required**: Computer/tablet access (_**not** smartphone_) with headphones, fast Internet, non-distracting area (not coffeeshop). You'll watch/listen to live video/audio, interact with classmates, and type to chat or code.

**Professor**: Yekaterina Kharitonova  / Prof K (pronouns: she/they)

**Course mentors** (TAs / ULAs): see [more info here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/staff); office hours are [linked here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule).

**Class time**: Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30--10:45am PT (Pacific/California time), synchronously on Zoom (the link is posted on Gauchospace)

> Make sure to use your <span style="color:red">**7-digit student ID _without_ any dashes or spaces** (ONLY digits)</span>. (‚ö†Ô∏è  <span style="color:orange">_You might fail the course if this ID is incorrectly entered._</span>)

### Communication
**Do _not_ message us individually**. 

Please use the Q&A platform **Piazza** to communicate with the Instructor and course mentors (you can contact us directly via a non-public message). You can also post on this forum anonymously to your classmates.

For emergency communications with the Instructor send an email with the <span style="color:green">subject that includes "CSW8"</span> (emails without this subject might not be seen).

We will always use only the official course platforms to reach out to you: posts on Piazza, Gauchospace, Gradescope, and ucsb email. If anyone contacts you through an unofficial channel claiming to be a mentor/instructor, please send a message via Piazza to the Instructors.

### Course Tools
We recommend bookmarking the following links:
* [Gauchospace](http://gauchospace.ucsb.edu) (grades, schedule, weekly reflection, quizzes, relevant course links), 
* [zybook](https://learn.zybooks.com/library) (PAs, CAs, LAs -- see below), 
* [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) (quizzes, project), 
* [Piazza](https://piazza.com) (Q&A forum)
* [this course website]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}) is for convenient access to the course information

The links to the form to request an extension and to submit anonymous feedback are linked below.

You will also submit your work through Google Forms or Qualtrics links - they will be posted via Gauchospace.

### Course structure and deadlines

<span style="color:green">Each week covers one chapter in zyBooks</span>. Due each week (always, at <span style="color:green">9 o‚Äôclock</span>):
> **PAs** for the week are due **before** the 1st class of the week <span style="color:green">Tuesday 9am</span> (Week 1 is the exception, they are due along with the PAs for Week 2)

> **CAs** for the week are due **before** the next-week <span style="color:green">Tuesday 9am</span>

> **LAs** for the week due **before** the next-week <span style="color:green">Wednesday 9am</span>

Deadlines for all activities are available on Gauchospace (and are listed on the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar)). 

<span style="color:green">There are hard deadlines **every Sunday at 9pm** beyond which we **will not accept late submissions**.</span>
During the quarter, you can request an extension for the zyBook activities (we can offer extension only for the zyBooks activities) - see more information [below](#request-for-accommodations).

It is the responsibility of each student to make sure their activity grades on zybooks are completed as expected and the correct score is displayed on Gauchospace. A portion of the LA score may be based on hidden tests and our manual inspection of code.

## Request for accommodations
**Any such requests need to be arranged with the DSP** (see below). 

### Deadline extension for zyBook activities
During the course of the term, you can request up to a total of **two (2) 12-hour extensions** for the weekly deadlines of the **zyBook activities** (we can offer extension only for the zyBooks activities, not the quizzes, reflections, etc.). No need to contact us via the forum or the email. 

[Submit this form to request an extension](https://forms.gle/KDjxnPZYJxYSm3R19) for the PAs, CAs, and/or LAs for 12 hours (your scores will be collected at 9am on Monday, instead of Sunday 9pm). You can also check two boxes (two 12-hour extensions) to get an extension for 1 day (your scores will be collected at 9pm on Monday, instead of Sunday 9pm).
You need to submit this form **before the Sunday 9pm** deadline.

If your situation is more serious and requires a longer extension, you need to provide the official documentation and complete the steps described in the sectin below. Please, do not contact us without providing documentation (e.g., even the processed tickets to fly home for an emergency can count as documentation).


### Personal / Technology / Health / Living Situation Issues
If there are issues which are affecting your ability to meet course deadlines, please reach out to the professor (see the Communication section above) as soon as you find out about the issue, **before the due dates occur**. Otherwise, _we do not accept late work or provide individual make-up assignments_.

An extension due to an emergency must be based on an **official documentation** that shows your name, the reason/issue description, and dates; you can black out any sensitive information and send it along _directly to the professor_ **as soon as possible**.

### Collaboration
You can help each other by engaging in discussion on the official course Q&A forum. **Do not share your code from _any_ course assignments (especially quizzes, zyBook activities and the project) on _any_ online site or with anyone else**. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Doing so, will be considered a case of academic dishonesty and can result in failing the course. 

Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. You may work on some of the LAs with a partner _only if it is indicated on the assignment_.  Even if you are working with a partner you should each substantially contribute, and develop/submit each in your own zyLab windows (we can see your progress history). **Having others code assignments for you, or copy-pasting code from elsewhere, IS NOT ACCEPTABLE and is a violation of the university policies.** 
Penalties for cheating are severe ‚Äî they range from a zero grade for the assignment up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense. 
Students are responsible for understanding and abiding by UCSB's academic integrity policies (<https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity>).

Assignments allow you to practice skills and concepts, and prepare you for quizzes and the project. Students who do not follow the policies of the course on collaboration and academic honesty will be **reported to the office of academic honesty and should expect to receive an F in the course**. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **_All_** students involved in an incident, _regardless if they are copying or sharing their work_, are going to be reported to The Office of Student Conduct.  The process and possible consequences are outlined here: <https://www.sa.ucsb.edu/regulations/student-conduct-code/student-conduct-code>.

If you have doubts or questions about what is allowed, please ask us via the forum.
Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! We are here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

üåü We provide you with a set of notes on [How to Succeed in this or any other computing course]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success), and we are available to help you on the forum and during class and office hours, so that you can learn and do your work effectively and efficiently.

## Campus Resources
    
### Managing Stress and Mental Health
Students may feel overwhelmed or depressed with coursework, stress, anxiety, relationships, cultural differences, and/or other personal challenges. If you find yourself, or another student, in need of support, please do not hesitate to reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), 24/7 at (805)893-4411, <http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu>.

### Disabled Students Program (DSP)
UCSB provides academic accommodations to students with disabilities. DSP serves as the campus liaison regarding issues and regulations related to students with disabilities. If you have a disability that requires accommodation in this class, please contact the DSP very early on in the quarter. We will only honor these types of requests for accommodation via the DSP. More information about the DSP is found here: <http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu>.

### Diversity and Inclusiveness
We (instructor and mentors) strive to create an environment in which students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives can be well-served and where the diversity that the students bring to this class is viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. We intend to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, culture, or religion (or lack thereof). 

_Disrespectful, unprofessional, and otherwise inappropriate behavior can be grounds for receiving a zero in this course._

Help us improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups; help us create a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. If at any point you are made to feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or excluded by the course staff or fellow students, please, don‚Äôt hesitate to talk to us about it so that we may address the issue and maintain a supportive and inclusive learning environment. If you are uncomfortable bringing it up with the course staff directly, [submit anonymous feedback](https://forms.gle/RSM53V1B6gmyFr3G9) or contact the [Office of the Ombud](https://ombuds.ucsb.edu/students/services).
